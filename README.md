# Simple Terminal
My build of suckless's simple terminal.
The applied patches are in .assets/patches/. Feel free to remove that directory in your fork.
The colorscheme used is (colorschemes/)gruvbox-material(.c), included using the colors.c file.

## TODO
- [x] change the default term title from "st" to "~" to make it seem seamless with zsh
